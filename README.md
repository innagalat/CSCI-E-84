# *CSCI-E-84 - HW2*

This is a first homework I wrote using ProjectTemplate, an R package that
helps organising R projects for colloboration. Since you're reading this file, 
I'll assume that you want to run the project. Load the RStudio project file, 
and navigate to the folder called `src`. You will find a file there called
`dgalat_homework2.R`. Open the file and source it.


### ProjectTemplate reminder
Executing `reload.project()` allows to:

1. load any packages specified in the configuration file
2. load datasets stored in `cache` and `data` directories
3. preprocess data using files in `munge`
