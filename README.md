# CSCI-E-84 - HW2

This is a first homework I wrote using ProjectTemplate, an R package that
helps organising R projects for colloboration. Since you're reading this file, 
I'll assume that you want to run the project. Load the RStudio project file, 
and navigate to the folder called `src`. You will find a file there called
`dgalat_homework2.R`. Open the file and source it.

Executing `reload.project()` allows to:
    1) load any packages specified in the configuration file
    2) load dataset stored in the `data` directory
    3) preprocess data using the files in the `munge` directory
